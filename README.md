# the-future.sh

> A tiny CLI simulator to boot your future.

`the-future.sh` is not just a tool; it's an interactive web experience designed to inspire action. It frames the abstract idea of building a future in the familiar language of a command-line interface, reminding us that a vision, without a commit, is just a dream.

_(You can replace this with a link to your own screenshot)_

## Philosophy

The future isn't something you wait for; it's something you build, one commit at a time. This project embodies that philosophy through deliberate design choices:

- **Friction by Design**: Simply running `./future.sh` results in an error. This isn't a bug‚Äîit's the core message. Your future requires explicit vision and commitment.
- **Learning Through Failure**: The error-to-success journey mirrors real life. Understanding what's needed is part of the process.
- **Authentic Achievement**: When you finally boot your future with the right parameters, the success feels earned.

## Features

This project is a single, self-contained `index.html` file, but it's packed with features to create a compelling and shareable experience.

- **Realistic Terminal Interface**: A CLI-like environment simulated entirely in your browser, featuring a blinking cursor, colored output, and a familiar prompt (`$`).

- **Intro Animation**: When you first visit the page, an automated demo plays showing someone attempting to boot their future incorrectly:
    - Auto-types `./future.sh` with realistic timing
    - Shows the error message and usage instructions
    - Teaches new users what they need to do
    - Takes about 3 seconds total, creating anticipation
    - Can be skipped by pressing ESC
    
- **The Boot Command**: The core of the experience. Users must provide two critical flags to boot their future:
    
    - `--vision`: A string describing the future you want to build.
        
    - `--commit`: A string describing the first, concrete action you will take.
        
- **Interactive Mode (Training Mode)**: For those new to CLI, there's a guided mode that teaches the proper command structure:
    - Accessed via `./future.sh --interactive`
    - Walks users through the process step-by-step
    - Uses interactive Yes/No prompts with arrow key navigation
    - Shows the correct command format at the end
    - Generated images include a "TRAINING MODE" watermark
    - Designed as a learning tool, not a replacement for the real experience
        
- **Extended Options (NEW)**: Deepen your commitment with optional flags that enrich the boot sequence:
    - `--when`: Set a deadline for starting your commitment
    - `--first-step`: Define the very first micro-action you'll take
    - `--why`: Clarify your personal motivation
    - `--milestone`: Set an intermediate goal to track progress
    - When used, these options create a rich, tree-structured output showing your complete action plan
        
- **Internationalization**: Full multilingual support with manual control:
    - Detects language at page load using multiple methods (URL parameter, saved preference, browser language)
    - Supports URL parameters: `?lang=ja` or `?lang=en` for direct language selection
    - Saves language preference in browser for future visits
    - Manual language switching available with `lang [ja|en]` command
    - All messages, errors, help text, and social sharing are fully localized
    - Language setting persists throughout your session (no automatic switching based on input)
        
- **Shell Environment Commands**: Standard Unix commands for an authentic terminal experience:
    - `ls`: List files in the current directory
    - `cat <file>`: Display file contents with tab completion support:
        - Type `cat ` and press Tab to see available files
        - Type `cat R` and press Tab to auto-complete to `cat README.md`
        - `cat future.sh` shows "Permission denied" (the source is protected)
        - Supports `README.md` and `vision.txt` for reading
    - `clear`: Clear the terminal screen
    - `pwd`: Print working directory (`/home/future/commits`)
    - `whoami`: Display current user (`builder`)
    - `help`: Show available commands
        
- **Guide Command for Beginners**: A friendly hint system that helps lost users find their way:
    - After 3 consecutive errors (invalid commands or failed attempts), a hint appears: "üí° New here? Type 'guide' for beginner-friendly mode!"
    - Type `guide` (or `„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ` in Japanese) to immediately start interactive mode
    - The hint appears as a separate, highlighted line to catch attention
    - Any successful command resets the error counter
    
- **Success & Failure States**:
    
    - If the command is run without the required flags, a `[FATAL]` error is displayed, along with a `USAGE` guide and a philosophical tip.
        
    - On successful execution, the app displays a log of your future being initiated, including the iconic `Daemonizing... Your future is now running in the background. Keep committing.` message.
        
- **Command History**: Just like a real terminal, you can navigate through your past commands using the `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown` keys. The initial `./future.sh` command is pre-loaded into the history for convenience.
    
- **Perfectly Cropped Snapshot**: After a successful boot, a shareable image (`.png`) is automatically generated. The snapshot focuses only on your successful command and its output‚Äîno distracting error messages or failed attempts. This creates a clean, inspiring image perfect for sharing.
    
- **Interactive Share Prompt**: After successfully booting your future, you'll be asked "Would you like to share your future with others?"
    - Use arrow keys, number keys (1/2), or Y/N to make your choice
    - Selecting "Yes" reveals the share options
    - Selecting "No" returns you to the terminal with an encouraging message
    - 3-minute timeout automatically selects "No" if left idle
    
- **Easy Sharing**: When you choose to share, a share box appears with multiple options:
    
    1. **Download Image**: Save the generated snapshot directly to your device
    2. **Share on X**: Opens X (Twitter) with a pre-populated message
    3. **Share on Facebook**: Share your commitment on Facebook
    4. **Share on LinkedIn**: Post your professional future on LinkedIn
    
- **Share-Last Command**: Missed the share prompt? Use `share-last` to share your most recently booted future anytime during your session
        

## How to Use

### Standard Mode (Recommended)

1. Visit the website.
    
2. You will be greeted by an initial error message, prompting you for action.
    
3. At the prompt, type your command using the following format. You can use single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
    
    ```
    ./future.sh --vision "a world where everyone can create" --commit "start learning to code today"
    ```
    
    Note: All variations work: `future`, `./future`, `future.sh`, and `./future.sh`. The `./future.sh` format follows proper shell conventions for executing local scripts.
    
4. Press `Enter`.
    
5. Watch your future boot.
    
6. Use the buttons at the top to download your personal snapshot and share it with the world.
    

### Interactive Mode (Training)

For those unfamiliar with command-line interfaces:

1. Type `./future.sh --interactive` or simply `guide`
    
2. Follow the guided prompts to enter your vision and commitment
    
3. The system will show you the proper command format
    
4. Use the interactive Yes/No prompt to confirm:
   - Arrow keys (‚Üë/‚Üì) to navigate
   - Number keys (1/2) for quick selection
   - Y/N shortcuts
   - Enter to confirm your choice
    
5. Watch your future boot
    
Note: Interactive mode is designed as a learning tool. Images generated in this mode will include a "TRAINING MODE" indicator. For the authentic experience and shareable images without watermarks, use the standard command format.

### Shell Environment Commands

To enhance the CLI experience, the following standard shell commands are also available:

```bash
ls          # List files in current directory
cat         # Display file contents (with tab completion)
clear       # Clear the terminal
pwd         # Print working directory
whoami      # Display current user
help        # Show help message
lang        # Switch language (ja/en)
guide       # Start beginner-friendly guided mode
share-last  # Share your last booted future
```

These commands make the environment feel more authentic and help users familiarize themselves with basic shell operations.

```

## The Design Philosophy

This tool intentionally requires effort. In a world of one-click solutions, `the-future.sh` asks you to slow down and think. The command-line interface isn't just an aesthetic choice‚Äîit's a reminder that building a future requires:

1. **Clear Intent**: You must explicitly state your vision
2. **Concrete Action**: You must commit to a specific first step
3. **Personal Effort**: You must type it out yourself

The "error-first" design ensures that every successful boot feels meaningful. This isn't about making things difficult‚Äîit's about making them memorable.
